              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                CARHUB was founded in 2020 with a simple mission: to transform how people manage their vehicle information. 
                We recognized that traditional vehicle documentation systems were outdated and inefficient, often causing 
                frustration for vehicle owners.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Our team of automotive and technology experts came together to create a digital solution that would 
                simplify vehicle information management, making it more accessible, secure, and user-friendly.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Today, CAR HUB serves thousands of vehicle owners, helping them manage their vehicle registration, 
                license plate information, and moreâ€”all in one convenient digital platform.
